## ETL Data Pipeline Project
End-to-end ETL project using real-time data from the OpenWeather API. Weather data is extracted with Python, transformed using Pandas, stored in SQLite, and visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard with maps, filters, and KPIs.

## Project context 
To make a structure to collect and transform data from APIs, using OpenWeather API to practice. 

## Objective
Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline to prepare data for analysis and make a PBI basic dashboard. 

## Process

- Data cleaning and extraction
- Data loading for analysis in Power BI

## Tools
- Python
- Google Colab
- API
- Power Query / SQL
- Power BI

## Results
Clean dataset ready for visualization and analysis.

## Learnings
Improved understanding of ETL architecture, data quality and Data best practices.
